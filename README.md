[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kryptn/homepage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kryptn/homepage)

"Built" and deployed using Travis-CI

Currently just an excuse to implement a CI/CD pipeline to deploy a static site to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)

Todo:

* Make the actual build process more exciting.
* Move to [Pelican?](http://blog.getpelican.com/)
* Add content to this theoretical pelican site?
* Perhaps the process of making this project?
